// director 1 - Jon Favreau
var director1 = {
  Name: "Jon Favreau",
  Birthyear: "Oct 19, 1966",
  Bio: 'Actor, producer, writer and director Jon Favreau hit unlikely pay dirt when "Swingers" (1996), his low-budget, autobiographical indie about struggling young actors, turned he and co-star/real-life best friend Vince Vaughn into hot property seemingly overnight. Favreau parlayed his rising profile into a number of supporting big-screen roles as cynical side men, but he was more anxious to get behind the camera and direct bigger features.',

  Bio: 'A third-generation television writer, it came as little surprise when scripter Joss Whedon followed in his relatives\' footsteps, although his astonishing success as series creator, producer, screenwriter and feature film director surely impressed even his formidable family. Receiving his start as a writer on the sitcom "Roseanne" (ABC, 1988-1997) and serving as a script doctor on several noted studio films, Whedon later created the cult hit "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (The WB, 1997-2001; UPN, 2001-03), developed from a campy horror comedy of the same name he had also written years earlier.',

  Birthyear: "Jul 3, 1964",
  Bio: 'Peyton Reed could thank fellow filmmaker Edgar Wright for his big break. After a long established deal that would have had Wright-the writer/director behind "Shaun of the Dead" (2004) and "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" (2010)-adapting the Ant-Man comic to screen for Marvel Studios was nullified due to creative differences, Reed was brought in to fill his shoes on the production. Having cut his teeth on studio comedies like "Bring It On" (2000), "The Break-Up" (2006), and "Yes-Man" (2008), Reed was deemed an amenable choice for Marvel and Disney\'s "Ant-Man" (2015) picture: his first true step toward blockbuster moviemaking.',
